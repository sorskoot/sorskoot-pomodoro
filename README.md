# sorskoot-pomodoro

A Progressive Web App (PWA) Pomodoro timer built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.

## Development

Install dependencies and start the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Run tests:

```bash
npm test
```

Run tests in watch mode:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

## Building

```bash
npm run build
```

The output is written to `dist/`.

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

The app is deployed to GitHub Pages at `/sorskoot-pomodoro/`. Pass the base path at build time:

```bash
npm run build -- --base=/sorskoot-pomodoro/
```

The CI/CD pipeline (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) runs this automatically on pushes to `main`.

The service worker is registered relative to `BASE_URL`, so it works correctly at any sub-path. See [docs/PWA.md](docs/PWA.md) for details.

### Local preview

```bash
npm run preview
```
